# ROAR-NET API - Python

This repository contains a library with the python implementation of
the ROAR-NET API Specification and several algorithms. You can find
the full specification in the
[roar-net-api-spec](https://github.com/roar-net/roar-net-api-spec)
repository.

## Contents

This library contains protocol types for all operations in the
specification, and several algorithms that are currently supported by
the specification.

### Protocol types

Protocol types for the operations in the ROAR-NET API Specification
are defined in the module
[roar_net_api.operations](https://github.com/roar-net/roar-net-api-py/tree/main/src/roar_net_api/operations).
For example, the operation
[apply_move](https://github.com/roar-net/roar-net-api-py/tree/main/src/roar_net_api/operations/apply_move.py)
is defined in a protocol `SupportsApplyMove`.

This library considers an object-oriented approach, such that
operations should be implemented by a class of the first argument
type. For example, for the operation:

```text
apply_move(Move, Solution) -> Solution
```

we consider that it should be implemented as part of the class `Move`,
which means that the protocol type is defined as:

```python
SolutionT = TypeVar("SolutionT")

class SupportsApplyMove(Protocol[SolutionT]):
    def apply_move(self, solution: SolutionT) -> SolutionT: ...
```

### Algorithms

We support several algorithms that can be implemented following the
ROAR-NET API Specification. You can find the algorithms in the module
[roar_net_api.algorithms](https://github.com/roar-net/roar-net-api-py/tree/main/src/roar_net_api/algorithms). Here
is the current list of supported algorithms:

- Beam search: `beam_search`
- Best improvement: `best_improvement`
- First improvement: `first_improvement`
- GRASP: `grasp`
- Greedy construction: `greedy_construction`
- Random local search: `rls`
- Simulated annealing: `sa`

## Using

### Adding it to your project

To use this library add it to your project. For example, to add it to
a `uv` project you can do:

```bash
uv add roar-net-api
```

Alternatively, you can add it to a `requirements.txt` file or install
it with `pip` manually.

### Implement a model

To implement a model, we recommend that you take advantage of python
type hints to warn you about potential issues. For example, if you
would like your problem class to support the operations
`empty_solution` and `constructive_neighbourhood`, you can inherit
from the protocol types for these operations to get type checking, for
example:

```python
from roar_net_api.operations import (
  SupportsEmptySolution,
  SupportsConstructiveNeighbourhood
)

class ConstructiveNeighbourhood:
  ...

class Solution:
  ...

class Problem(
  SupportsEmptySolution[Solution],
  SupportsConstructiveNeighbourhood[ConstructiveNeighbourhood]
):
  def empty_solution(self) -> Solution:
    ...

  def constructive_neighbourhood(self) -> ConstructiveNeighbourhood:
    ...
```

where `...` would be for your implementation.

If you do this, your editor/IDE can inform you of potential issues in
the implementation.

For a full example, see the
[tsp.py](https://github.com/roar-net/roar-net-api-py/blob/main/examples/tsp/tsp.py)
file in the examples folder, which implements a model for the
travelling salesman problem that can be solved by all algorithms.

## Development

This library targets Python 3.11, in order to support the latest
version of `pypy` which allows for faster execution of algorithms. As
such, make sure to test your changes with the latest version of
`pypy`.

The project is managed with `uv`, please follow the instructions on
their [website](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to install it.

The code is checked with the following linters:

- `ruff`
- `mypy` in `strict` mode

Pull requests are checked against these linters.
